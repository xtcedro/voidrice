# Pedro M. Dominguez's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, inspired by the legendary Luke Smith's [Voidrice](https://lukesmith.xyz). A huge thanks to Luke Smith, wherever he may be, for inspiring me to dive into Linux three years ago. His work and videos planted the seeds that led me to create [Dominguez Tech Solutions](https://www.domingueztechsolutions.com) and [OKDevs](https://www.okdevs.xyz). Without his guidance, I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today.

These dotfiles are tailored for my specific workflow and adhere to my minimalist and functional philosophy.
- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim/nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- nsxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- mpv (video player)
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
- Bookmarks in text files used by various scripts (like `~/.local/bin/shortcuts`)
	- File bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-files`
	- Directory bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-dirs`

## Usage

I also recommend trying out
[mutt-wizard](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard), which additionally
works with this setup. It gives you an easy-to-install terminal-based email
client regardless of your email provider. It is integrated into these dotfiles
as well.
