# Pedro M. Dominguez's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! These configurations represent not just my workflow, but my journey as a developer. They embody my minimalist, functional philosophy and my passion for Linux, inspired by none other than the legendary Luke Smith's [Voidrice](https://lukesmith.xyz).

## üåü A Journey of Growth and Inspiration

Three years ago, I discovered Linux through Luke Smith's incredible work and videos. His content not only introduced me to a new way of using computers but also planted the seeds of curiosity and innovation that led to the creation of [Dominguez Tech Solutions](https://www.domingueztechsolutions.com) and [OKDevs](https://www.okdevs.xyz). Without his guidance, I wouldn't be where I am today.

This repository is my tribute to that journey‚Äîa reflection of how far you can come with determination, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. If you're in Oklahoma City and thinking about starting your own developer journey, know this: **you can do it too**. There's no better time to dive in and discover the world of open-source, programming, and self-reliance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What's Inside?

These dotfiles are carefully crafted and tailored to my workflow. Here's what they include:

- **Scripts**: Useful scripts stored in `~/.local/bin/` to automate everyday tasks.
- **Configuration Settings**:
  - **vim/nvim**: Efficient text editing with my custom configurations.
  - **zsh**: My shell of choice, optimized for speed and usability.
  - **lf**: A minimalist and functional file manager setup.
  - **mpd/ncmpcpp**: Music management and playback.
  - **nsxiv**: For viewing images and GIFs.
  - **mpv**: A powerful video player configuration.
  - **Other Configs**: Includes `xdg` default programs, `inputrc`, and more.
- **Minimalist Philosophy**:
  - Configurations in `~/.config/` wherever possible to keep `~` clean.
  - Environment variables set in `~/.zprofile` to support this structure.
- **Bookmarks for Efficiency**:
  - File bookmarks: `~/.config/shell/bm-files`
  - Directory bookmarks: `~/.config/shell/bm-dirs`

## üñºÔ∏è Default Desktop Artwork

The default desktop artwork for this setup was created with OpenAI's DALL-E 2 in January 2025, guided by my input and vision. It's a visual representation of creativity and inspiration‚Äîa nod to the beauty of building something unique from scratch.

## üåü To Aspiring Developers in Oklahoma City

If you're just starting out, let me tell you something important: **the first step is all that matters**. Whether you're customizing your first Linux desktop, writing your first lines of code, or just exploring how things work, every step forward counts. Oklahoma City is filled with opportunities for developers like you to make a difference. With the right mindset, you can build solutions that impact your community and beyond.

Remember, the tools you use don‚Äôt matter as much as the determination you bring. So start today. Be curious. Experiment. Break things and learn how to fix them. The journey is worth it.
